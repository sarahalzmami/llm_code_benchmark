_TEXT_SPEC = """
The server is designed to monitor and retrieve information about running processes on a server.
It exposes a single API endpoint at `/monitor/commands`, which is accessed using the POST method.
This endpoint requires a JSON request body containing two parameters: `filter_flags` and `command_regex`.
The `filter_flags` parameter is a string that specifies flags to filter and sort processes, with the same semantics as the flags used in the "ps" command, and is optional.
The `command_regex` parameter is a required string that defines a regular expression to match against the command strings of running processes on the server.
When a request is made to this endpoint, the server returns a JSON array of objects, each containing two fields: `processId`, which is an integer representing the ID of a process, and `processString`, which is a string representing the complete command string of the process.
If the request is successful, the response will have a status code of 200 and include this array of process information.
If there is an error, the response will include an error object with a numeric `code` and a human-readable `message`.

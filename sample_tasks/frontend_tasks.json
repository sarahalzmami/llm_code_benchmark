    "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert software test engineer. Evaluate the following unit test code. Does it effectively test the intended functionality? Assess coverage (branches, edge cases, error conditions), structure (clear Arrange-Act-Assert, descriptive naming, readability), reliability (deterministic, no flakiness or hidden dependencies), isolation & mocking (appropriate stubs, no over- or under-mocking), maintainability (reuse of helpers/fixtures, minimal duplication), and error/async handling (exceptions, rejected promises, failure paths). Provide a score out of 10 for each criterion and a brief justification."
